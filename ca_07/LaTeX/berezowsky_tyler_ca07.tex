\section{Problem Statement} 
%Summarize the problem statement in one paragraph. Clearly state what the knowns are and what unknowns you must find.

The goal of this assignment is to help you visualize what covariance means in terms of the shape of a pdf.
We will rely heavily on  \sout{MATLAB's} matplotlib's 3D visualization tools. We will work exclusively with two random
variables.
The tasks to be accomplished are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a large number of random vectors of dimension 2 consisting of two independent uniformly
distributed random numbers over the range [0,1]. Estimate the pdf and plot in 3D using MATLAB's
functions like surf, mesh or the equivalent. Describe the shape of this plot.
\item Generate a set of Gaussian random vectors that have a 2x2 covariance matrix, estimate the pdf, and
plot in 3D. To keep things simple, use a mean of [6,6] for each example. Use the following covariance
matrices:

\begin{equation} 
cov_1(X,Y) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                     1 & 0 \\
                     0 & 1 
                 \end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
cov_2(X,Y) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                     1 & 0 \\
                     0 & 1 
                 \end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
cov_3(X,Y) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                     5 & 0 \\
                     0 & 2 
                 \end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
cov_4(X,Y) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                     1 & 0.5 \\
                     0.5 & 1 
                 \end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
cov_5(X,Y) = \left(\begin{matrix}
                     5 & 0.5 \\
                     0.5 & 2 
                 \end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation} 

\end{enumerate}
\section{Approach and Results} 
%Describe your approach to finding the unknowns. Use numbered figures, tables and equations where necessary.
\subsection{2 Dimensional Uniform Distribution} 
To develop a multivariate uniform distribution in $\Re$2, a two dimensional vector $x$ with length $N$ consisting of uniformly distributed values was generated.
\begin{equation}
x = \left( \begin{matrix}
				x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} \\ 
				x_{2,1} & x_{1,2} \\
				\dots & \dots \\ 
				x_{N,1} & x_{N,2}
			\end{matrix} \right)
\end{equation}  
This was fed into a two dimensional histogram function with a bin size $B$ for each axis. The bins were then normalized by dividing by the total number of possibilities $N^2$. The resulting PDF was plotted in $\Re3$. An illustration with $N = 1\times10^6$ and $B = 20$ can be seen in figure~\ref{fig: 2du} below.

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure_1}
	\caption{2 dimensional uniform distribution.}
	\label{fig: 2du} 
\end{figure}

As expected, the distribution is flat. The illustration does exhibit slight distortion from the expected shape due the resolution provided by the small range of the plot's axes. The variance of the PDF confirms the ``flatness'' of the plot. $\sigma = 2.62 \times 10^{-21}$.

\subsection{2 Dimensional Normal Distribution} 
The $\Re2$ multivariate normal distribution was generated utilizing a built in function \verb|multivariate_normal()| which is fed the length ($N$), dimension (2), and covariance matrix ($cov_k$). The output of the function is identical to the shape of $x$ described in the previous section, and therefore is treated also identically to illustrate in $\Re3$.  \\

To aid visualization, contour lines were added in addition to the surface plots. Two sets of plots were generated for covariance matrices, one consisting of both the surface and contour plots, and another consisting of only the contour plots. The result with $N = 1 \times 10^6$, $B = 25$, $\mu = (6,6)$ and the covariance matrices 1 to 5 can be seen below in figures~\ref{fig: 2dn} and \ref{fig: 2dnc}.
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure_2}
	\caption{2 dimensional normal distribution illustrated through surface and contour lines.}
	\label{fig: 2dn} 
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure_3}
	\caption{2 dimensional normal distribution illustrated throughcontour lines.}
	\label{fig: 2dnc} 
\end{figure}

$cov_1$ and $cov_2$ are identical matrices, but their multivariate distributions are clearly different in there range of possible values. There shape is nearly identical as displayed by the contour lines with a circular base and symmetrical Gaussian projections on the $XZ$ and $YZ$ plane. For matrix $cor_3$ the distribution's projections on the $XY$ plane are still circular, but the projections on the $XZ$ are $YZ$ are no longer symmetrical to each other. There is a higher tendency and a wider range for $X$ compared to $Y$.   \\

For the matrices $cor_4$ and $corr_5$ the distribution's projections are not symmetrical in the $XZ$ and $YZ$ planes, and the projections in $XY$ plane are now elliptical. The matrices $cov_1$, $cov_2$, and $cov_3$ are all ``fundamentally identity matrices'' (Is there a word?) where the PDF of $X$ and $Y$ maintain independence in the distribution. This is not the case for $cov_4$ and $cov_5$.

\section{Conclusions} 
%Summarize what you found.
Visualizing data in $\Re3$ is entertaining. A two dimensional uniform uncorrelated PDF is flat. A two dimensional normal distribution which is uncorrelated has circular projection on the $XY$ plane. A two dimensional normal distribution which is correlated has an elliptical projection on the $XY$ plane.
